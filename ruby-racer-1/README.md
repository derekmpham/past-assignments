# Ruby Racer: Outrageous Fortune

## Summary


Vroom vroom! We're going to build a simple game called *Ruby Racer*. This is a game in the same sense that [Chutes and Ladders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders) is a game: roll the die and move forward.  There's no strategy or decision making, just hope for big rolls.

The game is a race between two players.  Both players start at the beginning of the track, side-by-side.  Players take turns rolling a die and advancing along the track until one of them reaches the end of the track and wins the game.  (See Figure 1.)

Some challenges in building our game will be (1) managing the state of the game (e.g., keeping track of player positions) and (2) transforming data from one structure to another (e.g. transforming the game data into a printable board).
